          <p>
            Any claim or dispute between you and Bluemercury that arises in
            whole or in part from the Sites or the Interactive Services shall be
            decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in
            the District of Columbia, U.S.A. If any provision of these Terms of
            Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
            invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the
            remaining provisions of these Terms of Use, which shall remain in
            full force and effect. No waiver of any term of these Terms of Use
            shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any
            other term, and Bluemercury's failure to assert any right or
            provision under these Terms of Use shall not constitute a waiver of
            such right or provision. It is the express wish of the parties that
            these Terms of Use and all related documents be drawn up in English.
            TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPliCABLE LAWS, YOU AND BLUEMERCURY
            AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE
            SITES AND THE INTERACTIVE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR
            AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION
            IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
