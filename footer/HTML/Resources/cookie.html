          <p>
            We use advertising cookies to: deliver information about our

            delivered to your home, email, third-party sites or applications,
            and mobile devices); provide interactive features on our websites
            and mobile applications (e.g., product ratings and reviews,
            real-time offers, and location-based services such as store maps);
            identify product preferences and shopping preferences (e.g.,
            services and promotions of possible interest); and to administer
            contests, sweepstakes, promotions, surveys, and focus groups. Some
            of these advertising cookies are also used to track visitors across
            websites. The intention is to display ads that are relevant and
            engaging for the individual user and thereby more valuable for
            publishers and third party advertisers.

          <h2>Third Party Sale Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to
            opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties.
            These cookies collect information for analytics and to personalize
            your experience with targeted ads. You may exercise your right to
            opt out of the sale of personal information by using this toggle
            switch. If you opt out we will not be able to offer you personalised
            ads and will not share personal information with any third parties.
            Additionally, you may contact us for further clarification about
            your rights as a California consumer by using the Do Not Sell My
            Personal Information link in the footer of the site. If you have
            enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we have
            to take that as a valid request to opt-out. Therefore we would not
            be able to track your activity through the web. This may affect our
            ability to personalize ads according to your preferences.
